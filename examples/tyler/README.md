## How to Use This Example

1. **Study the journey diagram** - See how milestones connect
2. **Review the swimlane** - Understand parallel work coordination
3. **Read the AAR** - Learn from what happened
4. **Copy the structure** - Use these patterns for your projects

## Key Patterns Demonstrated

- Priority color coding (P1-P4)
- Milestone diamonds for decision points
- Dependency arrows between swimlanes
- Blocked status visualization
- Time-based layout (left to right)
